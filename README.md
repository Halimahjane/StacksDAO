# StacksDAO - Clarity Governance DAO Contract

This is a decentralized governance smart contract written in [Clarity](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/clarity-language/overview), designed for a token-weighted voting system on the Stacks blockchain. It allows users to propose and vote on governance decisions using a governance token.

## üìã Features

* Proposal creation with quorum and duration settings
* Voting with `for`, `against`, and `abstain` options
* Automatic status calculation after voting period ends
* Proposal execution logic (simulated)
* Configurable governance parameters by contract owner
* Token minting (for testing/demo purposes)

---

## üß± Data Structures

### Proposals

Each proposal includes:

* Creator, title, description, and link
* Start and end block for voting period
* Quorum threshold (minimum votes required)
* Vote tallies: for, against, abstain
* Status: active, passed, rejected, or executed

### Votes

Tracks individual votes per user per proposal:

* Vote type
* Weight (based on token balance)
* Timestamp (block height)

### Token Balances

Simple token balance mapping used for vote weight.
